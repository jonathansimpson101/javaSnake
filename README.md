# JavaSnake

## A Small Canvas project using only vanilla Javascript.

### Game Rules

###### 1. Every time you eat an apple, the length of the snake increments by 1.
###### 2. If you touch either the walls or your own tail, it's game over.
###### 3. The aim of the game is to achieve the highest score possible (duh).
